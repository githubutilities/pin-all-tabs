# Pin All Tabs -- Chrome Extension

Sometime, we open too many tabs in one window that we may accidentally click the close button of the tab. Also too many tabs in one window cost too much space and annoying. 

Since chrome does not provide keyboard shortcut to pin a tab and pinning a tab requires you to right click on it and click `Pin Tab`, this process is exhausted. That's why Pin-All-Tabs Chrome Extension comes in handy.
